## Hey! :) Im Ángel Allepuz 
### I'm a Telecom / ML Engineer from Spain!
This will a place where I post my experiments. Mostly ML / AI and also some API stuff most likely.

The AI ones (for now) will be around testing and evaluating cutting-edge models on their actual intelligence. 
For this I plan to develop my own metrics, although ARC-AGI-2 is pretty great.

I would love to collaborate with people on this endevour, so, reach out!!
